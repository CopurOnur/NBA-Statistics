# Overview

Data analytics have changed the sports industry and NBA is not ex-
caption. NBA teams are hiring statisticians in the order they help to select
players using Money ball techniques. We will try on the role of NBA data
analyst aiming to predict the outcomes of NBA regular-season games by
building a binary classification models. In addition to this, we will try to
predict the shots of Lebron James and the game results of Lebron teams by
considering only his performance.

# Main research aim and framework

We have 3 main goals in this Project; Predicting the result of NBA games.
Predicting the outcome of Field goal attempts of Lebron James. Predicting
game results of Lebron teams by considering only his performance. Statistical
tools and approaches are widely used in any sport because they provide accurate
and useful information. Especially for the NBA, where there are lots of independent
variables that can affect game results or even the whole season. NBA has a
lot of predictable and unpredictable aspects. The season itself is dynamic during
the year in terms of transfers, injuries, coach changes, changing performance of
the players, etc. Some games are easy to predict, some are impossible. For that
reason, it is very interesting work on NBA data.
